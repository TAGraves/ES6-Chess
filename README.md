# ES6-Chess
A simple chess game engine built on ES6 and node.

A GUI is currently under development. Interaction with the GUI is as of yet unavailable; gameplay is made through the Game.js controller in the `debug` function. To use, edit moves in the `debug` function and then log the board state and each player's pieces. Then open index.html or run src/js/app.js in node.
