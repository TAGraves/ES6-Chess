# ES6-Chess
A simple chess game engine built on ES6 and node.

Since there's no GUI yet, gameplay is made through the Game.js controller in the `debug` function. To use, edit moves in the `debug` function and then log the board state and each player's pieces. Then open index.html and check the console or run src/js/app.js in node.
