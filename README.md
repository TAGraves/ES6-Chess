# ES6-Chess
A simple chess game engine built on ES6 and node.

A GUI is currently under development. Drag and drop has just been implemented, so the game is almost essential feature complete. `Game.debug()` in `src/js/controllers/Game.js` runs a set of moves before the application loads; remove everything from that function to begin the game in a fresh state. Run `grunt` in the source directory to build the most recent version of the game.

Yet to implement:
Pawn promotion
Checkmate
